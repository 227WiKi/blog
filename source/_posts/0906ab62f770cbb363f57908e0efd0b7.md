Mizuha hates mushrooms and I hate boiled carrots. Both of them were in our bento.... somebody doesn’t like us.... which isn’t a surprise because we too hate ourselves.


You guys are saying our ship name is MizuSally as if she’s the alpha in this relationship 👭pshhhh 


Sorry to disappoint, I’m gonna have to change it to AmaMizu (which actually means “rain water” in Japanese so I think it’s so beautiful like the relationship we have🧚🏻‍♂️🧚‍♀️) no but real talk we cry so often with each other “rainwater” is the most perfect name for us 


WHAT HAPPENS AFTER RAIN? 🌧🌧


THERE’S A 🌈🌈🌈🌈 RAINBOW~🌜🌈🌛


This ship 🚢 was bound to sail. And you know what?
It’s free shipping. 


You guys already know I’ve been hitting on her since the final audition. I straight up walked up to her in the bathroom saying she’s really pretty until she ran away. She’s finally accepted my love. 


okay well leaving that aside, I’m gonna take you guys into the inside of our friendship 


This is a picture of when our manager told us to shut up because she was filming a video for twitter and our obnoxious voices were in all the videos.

So our extra asses went all the way to the point of holding our breath turning purple until we heard her say we can breathe again.



Here’s a picture of us pretending to be mukbang youtubers during the break time when every other member was eating their bento 🍱 in peace.  


Usually we have to ask each member whenever we use pictures of each other on our blogs just in case they don’t want it uploaded, but both of us are too lazy to ask each other that our blogs run on a trust based system. We both trust our photoshopping skills 🔥


Anyway! Today’s a pretty big day for Mizuha (I’m not gonna tell you why for personal reasons) BUT PLEASE SEND HER LOTS OF ❤️ LOVE 


I LOVE YOU AND SUPPORT YOU NO MATTER WHAT GIRL!! GOOD LUCK TODAY!!

🍪 🗑 : yes it’s perfectly okay to live without a dream. Honestly having a dream doesn’t always mean happiness. I sometimes would wish that I never had a dream of becoming a voice actress because every time some kind of hardship comes, I imagine that I wouldn’t feel pain if I never had a dream like this. 

You’re also still young >_< My dad’s already close to his 60s and he makes up new dreams every 5 seconds. You’re never too old to have a dream so I wouldn’t rush it for now. Until then, just study hard so that you’ll be ready for whatever dream you may encounter one day. Who knows? Maybe one day you’ll wake up and wish to be a doctor. Leave all possibilities open and try new things! 

I think becoming an adult isn’t as scary as you may think. I was also afraid of becoming an adult but lately, I’ve met so many motivational adults that it made me want to be like them. Yes there are responsibilities when you grow older BUT THAT ALSO MEANS MORE FREEDOM!! 

(Is what I tell myself because I too am still afraid of becoming an adult lol. Let’s live in fear together. More the merrier!) 

I hope this helped a bit. I have so many more things to say but it’s so much and too hard to explain through writing I feel like I want to tell you during a stream or something. 

Best of luck for all of you guys ❤️ I love and support you no matter what (unless it’s a crime. I don’t know maybe I’ll stoll low key support it. )🤔

水巴讨厌香菇，而我讨厌煮熟的胡萝卜。结果这两样都在我们的便当里……肯定是有人不喜欢我们……不过这也不奇怪，因为我们也有点讨厌自己。<br>
<br>
你们竟然说我们的组合名（Ship name）叫“水莎莉（MizuSally）”，搞得好像她在这段关系里是攻的一方似的👭哼——<br>
<br>
抱歉要让大家失望啦，我打算把它改成“天水（AmaMizu）”（这在日语里其实是“雨水”的意思，我觉得这个词就像我们的关系一样美丽🧚🏻‍♂️🧚‍♀️）。不，说正经的，因为我们经常对着彼此哭鼻子，所以“雨水”这个名字对我们来说简直完美。<br>
<br>
雨后会发生什么呢？🌧🌧<br>
<br>
会有🌈🌈🌈🌈 彩虹哦～🌜🌈🌛<br>
<br>
这对组合🚢注定要启航。而且你们知道吗？这可是包邮（Free shipping）的哦。<br>
<br>
大家都知道我从最终试镜开始就一直在撩她。我直接在洗手间走向她，一直夸她好漂亮，直到她逃跑为止。她终于接受我的爱了。<br>
<br>
好啦言归正传，我要带大家深入了解一下我们的友谊内部。<br>
<br>
这张照片是经纪人叫我们闭嘴的时候拍的，因为她当时正在拍发推特用的视频，而我们吵闹的声音全被录进去了。<br>
<br>
所以我们这两个戏精甚至屏住呼吸直到憋得脸色发紫，直到听见她说我们可以呼吸了为止。<br>
<br>
这是一张我们在休息时间假装成吃播YouTuber的照片，当时其他成员都在安安静静地吃便当🍱。<br>
<br>
平时我们在博客上发合照之前都得问过对方，以防万一对方不想被上传，但我们俩都懒得问彼此，所以我们的博客是建立在一种“信任机制”上的。我们都深信彼此的修图技术🔥<br>
<br>
总之！今天对水巴来说是个非常重要的日子（因为私人原因我不能告诉你们为什么），但是请大家给她多多的❤️爱。<br>
<br>
无论发生什么，我都会爱你并支持你的，女孩！！今天加油！！<br>
<br>

🍪 🗑：是的，没有梦想也完全没关系。老实说，拥有梦想并不总是意味着幸福。有时我甚至会希望自己从未有过当声优的梦想，因为每当遇到困难时，我就会想，如果我从未有过这样的梦想，也就不会感到痛苦了。<br>
<br>
你还很年轻呢 >_< 我爸爸都快60岁了，他还是每隔5秒就冒出个新梦想。追求梦想永远不会太晚，所以现在不用急于求成。在那之前，只要努力学习，为某天可能遇到的梦想做好准备就行。谁知道呢？也许有一天你醒来会想当一名医生。保留所有的可能性，去尝试新事物吧！<br>
<br>
我觉得变成大人并没有你想象中那么可怕。我也曾害怕长大，但最近我遇到了很多充满动力的大人，这让我想变得像他们一样。是的，长大后会有很多责任，但那也意味着更多的自由！！<br>
<br>
（这是我用来安慰自己的话，因为其实我也还是很害怕长大 哈哈。让我们一起生活在恐惧中吧。人多力量大嘛！）<br>
<br>
希望这些能有一点点帮助。我还有很多想说的，但字数太多了，用文字很难解释清楚，感觉我想在直播或者什么时候告诉你们。<br>
<br>
祝大家好运❤️ 无论如何我都会爱你们、支持你们的（除非是犯罪。但我也不太确定，也许我还是会偷偷支持一下下。）🤔
