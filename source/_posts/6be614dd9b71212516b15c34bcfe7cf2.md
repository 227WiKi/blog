I’m actually really terrified to put what I’ve been going through into words and to make an official announcement like this and I honestly don’t know if I’ll be able to get everything across to you guys. But I hope that you will read this til the very end and understand my thoughts.

I know there was an announcement made on the 22/7 official website but I wanted you guys to hear it from me as well.

As announced on the website, starting from the release of the 4th single, I will be taking a break from several group activities including the handshake events, high touch events, and individual meet&greet events.

From the very beginning of starting my career in 22/7, I’ve suffered from social anxiety disorder.

Until now, I have been participating in group activities with the monitoring and consultation of several doctors, staff members, and my parents.

Some of you guys, if not all, have probably noticed that from the release of our 3rd single, I have only participated in one time slot of all the handshake events.

To tell everybody the truth, before the release of our 3rd single, I had many meetings with the staff members to discuss whether I would be able to partake in the individual meet&greets at all. At that point, the doctors and staff members were advising me to take a break from these events to focus on my health. However, I felt as if I would be letting the people who have supported me down if I were to do so. After expressing my thoughts to the adults, they allowed me to continue with one time slot considering my health conditions.

But even after trying and having the strong desire to continue to try, it became clear that my health just wasn’t keeping up with those emotions. Talking to the doctors once again, they have told me that it would be best for me to take a break for awhile and after many discussions, I have decided to follow their advice.

I just didn’t know how I should tell everybody the circumstances. I was afraid of making my social anxiety public in the first place, which made me keep it to just myself and the adults around me for the past few years I’ve been in this group.

I was afraid that maybe having a member like me would make the overall image of the group really negative, or that people would start to hate me and all these worries just made me think that keeping it out from the public would be the best decision.

But you guys mean so so much to me, words can’t even describe.

I can’t thank everybody enough for the constant love and support that you all give me.

And that is why I thought that being true to you guys was the least that I could do.

No matter how many times I felt like I couldn’t do it anymore, the kind words you guys gave me, and the support of my members and staff members are what made me push through.

With that being said though, what I’m trying to do right now is one of the scariest things that I’ve had to do. At this point I still don’t know what kind of reaction I’ll get and thinking about all the possible outcomes are very daunting.

But the one thing I want you guys to understand is that the me up until now has never been a lie.

To whomever I’ve met before and told my gratitude to, please know that those words always came from the bottom of my heart.

This decision is for a very positive future. I will try my best to get stronger as soon as possible for not only myself but for everybody who supports me.

Thank you for reading until the end. I hope you guys will accept my decision and continue to support 22/7 & myself.

要把我所经历的这些事写成文字，并像这样发布正式公告，其实让我感到非常恐惧，我真的不知道能不能把所有的心意传达给你们。但我希望大家能一直读到最后，理解我的想法。
<br>
虽然 22/7 官网上已经发布了公告，但我还是想亲口告诉大家。
<br>
正如官网所宣布的，从第 4 张单曲发售开始，我将暂停参加握手会、击掌会以及个人见面会等部分组合活动。
<br>
其实从在 22/7 开始活动的最初阶段起，我就一直饱受社交恐惧症的困扰。
<br>
直到目前为止，我一直在多位医生、工作人员以及父母的观察与商谈下，坚持参加组合活动。
<br>
虽然不敢说全部，但可能已经有粉丝注意到了，从第 3 张单曲发售起，所有的握手会我都只参加了一个部次。
<br>
跟大家说实话吧，在第 3 张单曲发售之前，我曾多次与工作人员面谈，讨论我究竟还能不能参加个人见面会。当时，医生和工作人员都建议我暂停这些活动，专心调理身体。但是，我觉得如果就这样休息的话，会辜负一直以来支持我的大家。在向大人们表达了我的想法后，他们考虑到我的身体状况，允许我以只参加一个部次的形式继续努力。
<br>
但是，尽管我努力尝试，也抱着想要坚持下去的强烈愿望，现实却是我的身体状况已经跟不上这些情感了。再次与医生沟通后，他们告诉我最好还是休息一段时间。经过多次讨论，我决定听从他们的建议。
<br>
我只是不知道该如何向大家说明这些情况。起初我很害怕公开自己患有社交恐惧症这件事，所以在加入组合的这几年里，我一直把它藏在心里，只告诉了身边的大人们。
<br>
我担心组合里有我这样的成员，会不会让组合的整体形象变得很负面，或者大家会因此讨厌我。这些忧虑让我觉得，不公开才是最好的决定。
<br>
但是，你们对我来说真的非常非常重要，言语根本无法表达。
<br>
无论多少次感谢，都无法表达我对大家一直以来的爱与支持的感激之情。
<br>
所以，我觉得至少要对你们保持坦诚，这是我唯一能做的。
<br>
无论我有多少次觉得快要坚持不下去了，正是大家温柔的话语，以及成员们和工作人员的支持，才让我能够挺过来。
<br>
虽说如此，此刻我正在做的事情，是我经历过最令我恐惧的事情之一。直到现在，我仍然不知道会得到什么样的反应，想到各种可能的结果都让我感到非常不安。
<br>
但有一件事我希望大家能够明白，那就是直到现在的我，从来没有说过谎。
<br>
对于每一个我曾见过并表达过谢意的人，请一定要相信，那些话全都是我的肺腑之言。
<br>
这个决定是为了走向一个非常积极的未来。不仅是为了我自己，更是为了每一个支持我的人，我会尽最大的努力尽快让自己变得强大起来。
<br>
谢谢你们读到最后。希望大家能接受我的决定，并继续支持 22/7 和我。
